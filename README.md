# AWS Auto Scaling Project üöÄ

This project demonstrates the creation and configuration of a **scalable AWS Auto Scaling infrastructure** using **Terraform** and **Bash scripting**. The system dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on CPU load and sends email notifications when instances are launched or terminated. Additionally, it uses stress testing to simulate high CPU load, showcasing the Auto Scaling mechanism in action.

---

## üåü Key Features
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  
   - All AWS resources, including EC2, Auto Scaling Groups, and SNS, are created and managed using **Terraform**.
2. **Dynamic Scaling:**  
   - Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on **CloudWatch metrics** (CPU utilization).
3. **Email Notifications:**  
   - Leverages **AWS SNS** to send notifications for instance launch and termination events.
4. **Stress Testing:**  
   - Utilizes the `stress` tool to simulate high CPU load, triggering the Auto Scaling mechanism.
5. **Automation:**  
   - A **Bash script** automates the deployment, execution, and cleanup processes.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Terraform**: To define and provision AWS resources.
- **AWS Services**:
  - **EC2**: Elastic Compute Cloud for scalable compute capacity.
  - **Auto Scaling Groups**: To handle instance scaling dynamically.
  - **SNS (Simple Notification Service)**: To send email notifications.

# Terraform Automation Script üõ†Ô∏è

This Bash script automates the initialization, application, and optional destruction of Terraform configurations for provisioning AWS infrastructure. It simplifies the deployment process and provides a seamless way to manage resources.

---

## üìã Features of the Script
1. **Terraform Installation Check**:  
   - Ensures Terraform is installed on the system before proceeding. If Terraform is not installed, the script exits with an error message.
2. **Terraform Initialization**:  
   - Initializes the Terraform working directory to download provider plugins and prepare the configuration files for execution.
3. **Terraform Apply**:  
   - Applies the Terraform configuration to create or update the AWS infrastructure.
4. **Optional Resource Cleanup**:  
   - Prompts the user to decide whether to destroy the Terraform-managed resources after execution.

# How It Works ‚öôÔ∏è

This section explains the core functionality and configuration of the **AWS Auto Scaling Project**, detailing how Terraform is used, stress testing is performed, and notifications are managed.

---

## **1. Terraform Configuration**
The infrastructure is defined using the following Terraform files:

- **main.tf**:  
  Configures the Auto Scaling Group, Launch Template, CloudWatch Alarms, and SNS notifications.
- **variables.tf**:  
  Stores variable definitions to allow flexibility in resource configuration.
- **outputs.tf**:  
  Defines outputs such as instance IDs and SNS topic ARNs to provide essential details after deployment.
- **provider.tf**:  
  Sets up the AWS provider required for managing AWS resources with Terraform.
- **data.tf**:  
  Fetches AWS-specific data, such as available regions, to ensure compatibility with the deployment.

---

## **2. Stress Testing**
- The `setup_script.sh` is automatically executed on every EC2 instance during launch. It performs the following steps:
  1. Installs the `stress` tool on the instance.
  2. Waits for **1 minute** to ensure the instance is fully initialized.
  3. Simulates high CPU load for **10 minutes**, causing the CPU utilization to exceed the threshold, which triggers the Auto Scaling mechanism.

---

## **3. Auto Scaling**
The Auto Scaling Group is configured to handle resource scaling dynamically:
- **Scale up**:  
  Launches additional instances when CPU utilization exceeds **50%**.
- **Scale down**:  
  Terminates instances when CPU utilization drops below **20%**.

---

## **4. Email Notifications**
- **AWS SNS** is integrated to notify users about scaling events. The notifications include:
  - **Launch events**: Sent whenever a new instance is created.
  - **Termination events**: Sent whenever an existing instance is terminated.

---

This section provides a clear overview of how the project operates, ensuring scalability, reliability, and real-time monitoring of the infrastructure.


# Deployment Instructions üßë‚Äçüíª

This section provides step-by-step instructions for deploying and testing the **AWS Auto Scaling Project**. Follow these steps to ensure the infrastructure is set up correctly and functions as expected.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure the following are ready:

1. **AWS Account**:
   - Ensure you have access to the following AWS services:
     - EC2
     - Auto Scaling
     - SNS
     - CloudWatch

2. **AWS CLI**:
   - Install and configure the AWS CLI:
     ```bash
     aws configure
     ```

3. **Terraform**:
   - Install Terraform on your local system:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install terraform
     ```

# Clone the Repository

- bash install_and_run.sh

**This script will:**

- Initialize Terraform.

- Apply the Terraform configuration.

- Prompt you to destroy the infrastructure after testing.


# ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow and Testing

1. **Terraform Configuration**
   
   - Provisions Auto Scaling Groups, Launch Templates, CloudWatch Alarms, and SNS topics.
   
3. **Stress Testing**

      **The setup_script.sh is executed on each EC2 instance:**
   
         - Installs the stress tool.
         - Simulates high CPU load for 10 minutes.
         - Triggers scaling events (scale up/down) based on CPU utilization.
   
5. **Auto Scaling Events**
      - Scaling Up: Launches new instances when CPU utilization exceeds 50%.
      - Scaling Down: Terminates instances when CPU utilization drops below 20%.

4. **Notifications**
      **AWS SNS Integration: Sends email alerts for:**
         - Launch Events: When a new instance is created.
         - Termination Events: When an instance is terminated.

# üìß Email Notifications
   **Launch Event:**
         - Subject: EC2 Instance Launched
         - Body: A new EC2 instance has been launched with ID: i-12345678.  
         - CPU utilization: 55%.  
         - Timestamp: 2025-01-21 14:00:00 UTC.  
   **Termination Event:**
         - Subject: EC2 Instance Terminated
         - Body: An EC2 instance has been terminated with ID: i-87654321.  
         - Reason: CPU utilization below threshold (20%).  
         - Timestamp: 2025-01-21 15:30:00 UTC.


# üîç Testing the Auto Scaling and Notifications
   - Simulating High CPU Load
Once an instance is launched, the setup_script.sh:
Installs and starts the stress tool.
Generates CPU load for 10 minutes, which triggers scaling.
   - Receiving Notifications
Email notifications are sent whenever:
A new instance is launched.
An existing instance is terminated.
   - Verifying Scaling
Use the AWS Management Console to verify:
Instances being launched or terminated.
Notifications sent via SNS.
